    in order to take advantage of pynbodys SPH modeling to generate our covering fractions, the pynbody.image function was used.
    this allows us to get a visual image of density(rho), which takes into account sph modeling to avoid having all the mass from particles located
    on their center.
    
    further detail on how this is done can be found in the "get CD" function, however in order for this to work, the rho for OVI and HI must also 
    be recalculated, as while each particles mass is independent of its surrounding (allowing us to simply multiply it by the respective ion fraction
    to derrive this) density depends on the mass of the surrounding particles.
    
    no built in pynbody function exists that does this directly, however, by setting the mass of the particle to equal the mass of OVI or HI 
    the call to sph.rho will return an array of particle masses based on the mass of the surrounding elements, hence while janky, the above is done.
    
    
    tldr: to use pynbodys sph functionality in calculating covering fractions, the density(rho) of OVI  and HI particles is needed
