    "I managed to get through the pipeline and remember what everything did well enough to comment it today, but didn't have time to test it on a new halo. However, if you'd like to try it in the next 24 hours or so, I've attached a zip file with steps 1-7 of my pipeline (there are 8 files, but TrackDownStars_rz.ipynb and FixHostIDs_rz.py are really two halves of a single step). Step 0 is creating a tangos db for the simulation you'll be working with and my pipeline uses that and the simulation itself to create an hdf5 file with relevant data for each star particle. The most important bits are a unique host ID for each star particle so that stars that formed in the same halo can be grouped together, even if that halo doesn't exist at z=0, and the orbital circularity of each star particle, which I use to identify members of the stellar halo.\n",
    "I will be testing it tomorrow on one of the newer Romulus Zooms, so there's a good chance I'll be sending you an updated version very soon with any bug fixes :) \n",
    "I apologize for how many pieces the pipeline is in - it really isn't all that complicated, but it was adapted from what I did for the FOGGIE sims and I split the steps of that pipeline up so that I could do as much as possible locally (rather than on Pleiades) and so that I could sanity check as often as possible. Please let me know if you have any issues, questions, or suggestions! I'd definitely be eager to hear what Juan does differently!"

    "**What it does:**\n",
    "- Reads all the `<sim>_stardata_*.h5` files created in Step 2 \n",
    "- For each simulation snapshot, identifies which halos formed new stars between that snapshot and the previous one\n",
    "- Counts how many stars formed in each halo during each time interval\n",
    "- Creates a comprehensive timeline of star formation activity across all halos\n",
    "- Outputs a summary text file listing star-forming halos and their activity over snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Process:**\n",
    "1. **File Discovery**: Locates all `*_stardata_*.h5` files from Step 2 using glob pattern matching\n",
    "2. **Data Extraction**: For each HDF5 file, extracts:\n",
    "   - `particle_hosts`: Host halo indices \n",
    "   - `timestep_location`: Snapshot numbers where each star particle first appears\n",
    "3. **Temporal Binning**: Groups star particles by the snapshot where they formed\n",
    "4. **Halo Counting**: For each snapshot, counts how many stars formed in each unique halo\n",
    "5. **Output Formatting**: Creates chronologically ordered summary with format:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   <snapshot_number>    <halo_id_1>,<star_count_1>    <halo_id_2>,<star_count_2>    ...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- **Key Technical Details:**\n",
    "- **Vectorized Operations**: Uses `np.unique(return_counts=True)` for efficient halo counting instead of slow loops\n",
    "- **Memory Efficient**: Processes one HDF5 file at a time to minimize memory usage\n",
    "- **Chronological Ordering**: Sorts output by snapshot number for temporal analysis\n",
    "- **Duplicate Handling**: Aggregates data from multiple stardata files that may have overlapping snapshots -->\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Files:**\n",
    "- Multiple `<sim>_stardata_<snapshot>.h5` files from Step 2\n",
    "- Each file contains star formation data for a subset of simulation snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output File:** `<sim>_halostarhosts.txt`\n",

    "- Each line represents one simulation snapshot\n",

    "- **Efficient I/O**: Single-pass reading of HDF5 files with minimal memory footprint -->\n",

    "**Purpose:** This step creates a compact summary of star formation activity that enables Step 4 to efficiently track halo merger histories and assign unique IDs to star-forming halos. \n",
    "<!-- The chronological format makes it easy to identify:\n",

    "Step 4 of stellar halo pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "- Reads the `<sim>_halostarhosts.txt` file created in Step 3 (which lists halos that formed stars at each snapshot)\n",
    "- For each star-forming halo, traces its merger history forward in time using Tangos database merger trees\n",
    "- Creates a unique, persistent ID for each halo that accounts for mergers and halo evolution\n",
    "- Assigns the same unique ID to stars formed in progenitor halos that later merge\n",
    "- Handles \"phantom\" halos (temporary tracking losses in halo finders) for robust merger tree following\n",
    "- Outputs a mapping file that connects local halo IDs to persistent unique IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Process:**\n",
    "1. **Input Parsing**: Reads the timeline of star-forming halos from `_halostarhosts.txt`\n",
    "2. **Merger Tree Traversal**: For each halo, uses Tangos database to trace descendants forward in time\n",
    "3. **Self-Consistency Checking**: Verifies that merger tree connections are bidirectional (descendant→progenitor matches)\n",
    "4. **Unique ID Assignment**: Creates IDs in format `<last_snapshot>_<halo_index>` where the halo was last independently identified\n",
    "5. **Progenitor Chain Building**: Links all progenitors in a merger chain to the same unique ID\n",
    "6. **Phantom Handling**: Accommodates temporary halo finder failures using robust tree traversal algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Technical Details:**\n",
    "- **Unique ID Format**: `SSSS_H` where `SSSS` = 4-digit snapshot number, `H` = halo index at that snapshot\n",
    "- **Forward Tracking**: Uses `trackforward()` function to find the last snapshot where a halo exists independently\n",
    "- **Merger Tree Validation**: Employs `checkmatch_p()` and `checkmatch_d()` to verify progenitor/descendant relationships\n",
    "- **Phantom Accommodation**: Filters out phantom halos (type > 0) but maintains merger tree integrity\n",
    "- **Caching System**: Uses dictionary `d` to store previously computed unique IDs for efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Unique ID Creation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Halo 5 at snapshot 3552 merges with halo 1 before snapshot 3553\n",
    "→ Unique ID: \"3552_5\"\n",
    "→ All stars formed in this halo's progenitors get ID \"3552_5\"\n",
    "→ Stars formed in halo 1 (after merger) get a different unique ID\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Workflow:**\n",
    "1. **For each timestep** in the simulation:\n",
    "   - **For each halo** that formed stars at that timestep:\n",
    "     - Check if unique ID already computed (use cached result)\n",
    "     - If not cached: trace forward to find last independent existence\n",
    "     - Create unique ID based on final independent snapshot\n",
    "     - Trace backward through progenitor chain\n",
    "     - Assign same unique ID to all progenitors in the chain\n",
    "     - Cache results for future lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merger Tree Functions:**\n",
    "- **`trackforward(step, halo)`**: Traces halo forward to find last independent snapshot\n",
    "- **`checkmatch_p(step, halo, hid, disp)`**: Verifies progenitor relationship\n",
    "- **`checkmatch_d(step, halo, hid, disp)`**: Verifies descendant relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Files:**\n",
    "- `<sim>_halostarhosts.txt` from Step 3 (timeline of star-forming halos)\n",
    "- Tangos database with merger tree information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output File:** `<sim>_uniquehalostarhosts.txt`\n",
    "- Text file with same format as input but with unique IDs replacing local halo indices\n",
    "- Format: `<timestep>\\t<unique_id>,<local_halo_id>[,<star_count>]\\t...`\n",
    "- Example line: `3840    3552_5,15,234    3721_42,42,156`\n",
    "  - At snapshot 3840: unique halo \"3552_5\" (local ID 15) formed 234 stars\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- **Performance Considerations:**\n",
    "- **Caching**: Avoids recomputing unique IDs for halos already processed\n",
    "- **Phantom Handling**: Designed for Rockstar halo finder but slows processing\n",
    "- **Database Queries**: Intensive use of Tangos merger tree calculations\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**: Stores merger tree data and caching dictionary -->\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special Cases Handled:**\n",
    "- **Unbound Stars**: Particles with host ID = -1 get unique ID `<snapshot>_0`\n",
    "- **Phantom Halos**: Temporary tracking losses in halo finder are filtered but accounted for\n",
    "- **Merger Events**: Multiple local halos can map to the same unique ID if they're part of the same merger tree\n",
    "- **Isolated Halos**: Halos that never merge retain their snapshot-specific unique ID\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This step solves the fundamental problem that halo IDs change over time due to mergers, making it impossible to track stellar populations. By creating persistent unique IDs, we can:\n",
    "- Group stars by their true formation halo, even after mergers\n",
    "- Trace stellar populations through cosmic time\n",
    "- Identify which stars belong to the main galaxy vs. accreted satellites\n",
    "- Enable stellar halo analysis based on formation environment\n",
