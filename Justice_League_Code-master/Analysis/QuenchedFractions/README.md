# Quenched Fractions

*Primary Notebook: `QuenchedFractions_F19.ipynb`*

    Note: the notebook *`QuenchedFractions.ipynb`* is out of date, but included in this folder because there is some interesting comparisons between the Justice League and Marvel simulations in there. For now it is left largely undocumented. 

## Data Used

Quenched fractions are generated from the redshift 0 dataset generated on 2019/11/29 (`/Data/z0_data/*`). 

Data for observational comparisons come from many places. The data from McConnachie (2012) comes from [Vizier](https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/AJ/144/4/catalog). Data from Weisz et al. (2015) comes directly from a table in their paper, and data from Karachentsev et al. (2013) come from the same Weisz paper, compiled. Data from the SAGA survey (Geha et al. 2017) come directly from their Table 2, [downloaded as ASCII](https://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/847/1/4/suppdata/apjaa8626t2_ascii.txt) and cleaned up. 


## Output Files

Output `QF_F19.png`, the quenched fraction as a function of stellar mass.
