# Quenching Timescales

*Primary Notebook: `SFR_Quenching_Times.ipynb'*

    Note: the notebooks `QuenchingTimescales.ipynb` and `QuenchingTimescales_F19.ipynb` are out of date, use different methods to calcualte these quantities, and are largely undocumented. However, there is some potentially useful code in there, so they are included in this repository. 

# Data Used

Quenching timescales are generated from the timesteps dataset (`/Data/timesteps_data/`). 

# Output Files

Quenching timescales are output to a `.data` file located at `/Data/QuenchingTimescales.data`. 

Specific plot outputs are `tq_ti.png`, the quenching time vs. the infall time, and `tau_mass.png`, the quenching timescale vs. the stellar mass.
